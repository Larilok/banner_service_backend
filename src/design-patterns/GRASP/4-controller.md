Controller
=====

### Problem:
- Who should be responsible for handling a system event?
- What first object beyond the UI layer receives and coordinates ("controls") a system operation?

### Solution:

Assign the responsibility to an object representing one of these choices:
- Represents the overall "system," a "root object," a device that the software is
running within, or a major subsystem (these are all variations of a facade
controller).
- Represents a use case scenario within which the system operation occurs (a use
case or session controller)
- Represents the overall business (facade controller)
- Represents something in real world that is active (role controller)


These classes often donâ€™t do the work themselves, but delegate it to others and in other terms it coordinates or controls the activity.

-----

- Deals with how to delegate the request from the UI layer objects to domain layer objects.
- when a request comes from UI layer object, Controller pattern helps us in determining what is that first object that receive the message from the UI layer objects.
- This object is called controller object which receives request from UI layer object and then controls/coordinates with other object of the domain layer to fulfill the request.
- It delegates the work to other class and coordinates the overall activity.
