Strategy
====

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors into objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object.

The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates it executing the behavior. In order to change the way the context performs its work, other objects may replace the currently linked strategy object with another one.

### Usage
- Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.
- Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.

Typescript

The Strategy pattern is very common in TypeScript code. Itâ€™s often used in various frameworks to provide users a way to change the behavior of a class without extending it.
