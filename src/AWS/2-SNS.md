SNS
===================
The fundamental idea of a publish/subscribe system is to allow communication between systems that are not directly connected by having one side publish messages to a shared location, called a "topic" in SNS, and having the other side subscribe to the messages from this location.

To publish a message to an SNS topic, a message producer must use the SNS HTTP API. Once the message is published, all subscribers receive a copy of the message over the channel through which they established their subscription.

SNS provides an HTTP API over which messages can be published to an SNS topic.
